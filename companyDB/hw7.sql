QL/DML SELF-LEARNING HOMEWORK (using the COMPANY database)
-- File: company-IndependentLearning.sql
/*
The following queries are intended to promote independent learning and research (which is one of the objectives of this course.) More specifically, the topics of the queries in this assignment are not covered in typical introductory textbooks or courses on database. However, we have by now acquired sufficient knowledge in SQL to independently study the SQL manual. The topics covered here are:
--
-- Using ROWNUM (oracle's way of implementint the LIMIT clause in SQL)
-- Top-N reporting.
-- RANK and DENSE_RANK" functions.
-- Hierarchical queries.
--
In writing the queries, you MUST NOT hard-code the values of the database in your queries (e.g. a 25000 salary) since a database is subject to change after one writes a query.
--
IMPORTANT SPECIFICATIONS 
--
(A)
Download the script file company.sql and use it to create your COMPANY database.
-- Downlnoad the file company.doc; it is provided for your convenience in order to check the results of your queries.
--
(B)
Implement the queries below by ***editing this file*** to include
your name and your SQL code in the indicated places.   
--
(C)
After you have written the SQL code in the appropriate places, do the following:
--
-- Run this file (from the command line in sqlplus).
-- Edit the resulting spooled file (company-IndependentLearning.out)in order to change the font to size 9.
-- Print the .out file and submit the printout in class.
--
**** Note: you can use Apex to develop the individual queries. However, you ***MUST*** run this .sql file from the command line as explained above and then submit a printout of the spooled file. Submitting a printout of the webpage resulting from Apex will *NOT* be accepted.
